Air-Route-Planning is a Command Line Interface program which allows users to find the shortest path between two airports while factoring in the limited fuel remaining on the plane. Users have to input their origin, destination and the distance they can fly with their current fuel level.

The program makes use of Djikstra's Algorithm for pathfinding while taking into account the limited fuel the plane has.

Type in `make` to compile the project and start up the Command Line Interface
